# zawiw-multi-languages
Simple multi-language Plugin, based on subdomains for each language

1.) Activate Plugin for your main language (e.g. english)
2.) Set Settings -> ZAWiW Multi Languages -> activate checkbox and set a language
3.) Activate Plugin for all the other blogs, that are other language versions
4.) For each of them, set fallback language to the blog, that you've activated the plugin for, in step 1
5.) Set languages, subdomains etc.
6.) Much fun ;)
